This package has classes for Book, Paper, Publication, and the Publication Manager. I have added a feature to calculate a statistic about the characters in the title of all publications added to the Publication Manager as well as a doi attribute to the Book and Paper. I have added a WebPage class that allows the system to ass references to web links. WebPage inherits from Publication. 
-------
I still need to know why addWebPage does not work, how to check if the webpage is valid, and check for the constructor, and add the method addWebpage to my publication manager. 
Still need to design and implement a way for users to remove citations that were added before.
