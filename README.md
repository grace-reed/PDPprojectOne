# PDPprojectOneBusiness Requirements
The client would like to create an app for the user to find a dog groomer with the most availability so the dog doesn't have to wait a long time to wait before and after washing. The app is also a social platform to share photos of their dogs with the community of friends. Then the trained TensorFlow MobileNet object detection model will pick up slight differences between clean and dirty dogs and give that information to a calendar with date and time. The MobileNet model will provide a binary data parameter of clean and dirty to a scheduling assistant that accounts for date, time, geographic location and the amount of users it suggests to travel to certain groomers to handle all of the users on the platform. Lastly, the scheduling assistant will show dog owners the best time to go to the groomer.
